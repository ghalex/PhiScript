Overview {#overview}
==============

### Introduction ###

**PhiScript** main goal is to provide every essential functionalities you need in the process of building web applications 
using **JavaScript**. When I start building PhiScript I just wanted a framework like [Adobe Flex SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/About) 
for **JavaScript**, becase [Adobe Flex SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/About) has some realy cool features that makes the development 
process very easy and fast. So if you are a Flex developer that wants to build applications using **JavaScript** this framework should be "gold mine" for you. 
If you don't know about Adobe Flex there is no problem PhiScript is very easy to use.

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ghalex/PhiScript).You can report bugs and discuss features on the [issues page.](https://github.com/ghalex/PhiScript/issues)
